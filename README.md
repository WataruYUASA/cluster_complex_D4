# cluster_complex_D4
Some data of the cluster complex of type D_4. All data is computed by using MATLAB.

## picture of cluster complex of type D_4
See `cluster_complex_D4.png`.
Vertices (clusters) are indexed by integers (1, 2, ... ,50).

## shortest paths from i to j
A shortest path from i to j with length n in the cluster complex of type D_4 is in `lenght_n.csv` (n=1,2,...,6). n>6 has no paths.
Rows are paths from index_1 to index_{n+1} (n=1,2,...,7).
