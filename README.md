# cluster_complex_D4
Some data of the cluster complex of type D_4. All data is computed by using MATLAB.

## picture of cluster complex of type D_4
See `cluster_complex_D4.png`.
Vertices (clusters) are indexed by integers (1, 2, ... ,50)

## shortest paths from i to j
Paths with length n in the cluster comples of type D_4 are in `lenght_n.csv`.
Rows are paths from index_1 to index_n.
